# üö® EMERGENCY: Fix Failed Migration

## What Happened

You got this error:
```
Error: P3009
The `20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing` migration started at 2025-10-24 01:38:45.044069 UTC failed
```

**This is expected!** The old SQLite migration failed on your PostgreSQL database (exactly what we predicted).

---

## Quick Fix (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Mark the failed migration as rolled back
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing

# 2. Deploy all migrations (including our new PostgreSQL one)
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Verify it worked
./scripts/verify-migration.sh
```

---

## What Each Command Does

### Command 1: Resolve Failed Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing
```

**What it does**: Tells Prisma "this old SQLite migration failed, mark it as rolled back so we can continue"

**Expected output**:
```
Migration `20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing` marked as rolled back.
```

### Command 2: Deploy Migrations
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**What it does**: 
- Skips the failed SQLite migration
- Applies our new PostgreSQL-compatible migration
- Creates all your tables

**Expected output**:
```
‚úì Applying migration `20251024020000_postgresql_baseline_migration`
All migrations have been successfully applied.
```

### Command 3: Verify
```bash
./scripts/verify-migration.sh
```

**What it does**: Checks that everything worked correctly

**Expected output**:
```
‚úÖ Migration appears successful!
‚úì Session table exists
‚úì 18 tables found
```

---

## Why This Happened

1. The old migration used **SQLite syntax** (`DATETIME`)
2. Your database is **PostgreSQL** (Supabase)
3. SQLite syntax **failed** on PostgreSQL
4. Prisma **marked it as failed** in the database
5. Now we need to **resolve** it and apply our new PostgreSQL migration

---

## Full Command Sequence

Copy and paste this entire block:

```bash
# Already set from before:
# export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:qWF0UP9PucYcjBzr@db.aptsjasxpdkcfvfagxfz.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Step 1: Resolve the failed migration
echo "Step 1: Resolving failed SQLite migration..."
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing

# Step 2: Deploy all migrations
echo "Step 2: Deploying PostgreSQL-compatible migration..."
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Step 3: Verify success
echo "Step 3: Verifying..."
./scripts/verify-migration.sh

echo "‚úÖ Done! Check your app now."
```

## If Step 1 Asks for Confirmation

It might ask: `Are you sure you want to mark this migration as rolled back?`

**Answer**: `yes` or `y`

This is safe - we're just telling Prisma to skip that broken SQLite migration.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Migration not found"
Run this to see all migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Error: "Cannot mark as rolled back"
Try marking it as applied instead:
```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251008130439_update_for_new_pricing
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Still Getting Errors?
Check what's in your database:
```bash
npx prisma db pull
```

This shows what tables actually exist.

---

## Alternative: Nuclear Option (Use Only If Above Fails)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This resets ALL migration history but keeps your data

```bash
# Delete migration history table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS _prisma_migrations;"

# Deploy all migrations fresh
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## What Happens Next

After these commands succeed:

1. ‚úÖ Failed SQLite migration is marked as resolved
2. ‚úÖ New PostgreSQL migration is applied
3. ‚úÖ Session table is created
4. ‚úÖ All 18 tables exist
5. ‚úÖ Your app works!

---

## Expected Timeline

- Command 1: 5 seconds (resolve)
- Command 2: 30 seconds (deploy)
- Command 3: 10 seconds (verify)
- **Total**: ~1 minute

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:

- ‚úÖ No more "P3009" error
- ‚úÖ Migration deploy completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Verification script passes
- ‚úÖ App loads without MissingSessionTableError

---

**Run those 3 commands now!** You're almost done! üöÄ
