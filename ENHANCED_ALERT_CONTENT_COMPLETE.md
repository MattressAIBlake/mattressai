## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### `app/lib/alerts/alert.service.server.ts`

  }>;

}
```

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Consent

### GDPR Compliance Maintained

The existing consent logic is still enforced:
- If `consent = false`, all PII is redacted
- Products are still shown (not considered PII)
- Summary is redacted if no consent
- CRM integrations (Podium, Birdeye) still require consent

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### 1. Test Email Alert

```bash
# Using the admin integration test endpoint
POST /app/admin/integrations/test
{
  "channel": "email",
  "config": {
    "to": "your-email@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Receive formatted email with sample products, contact info, and images
- Verify mailto: and tel: links are clickable
- Check that images display properly

### 2. Test SMS Alert

```bash
POST /app/admin/integrations/test
{
  "channel": "sms",
  "config": {
    "to": "+15551234567"
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Receive concise SMS with lead name, phone, and product
- Verify message is under 160 characters
- Check for ✓ indicator on clicked product

### 3. Test Slack Alert

```bash
POST /app/admin/integrations/test
{
  "channel": "slack",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Receive rich Slack message with structured blocks
- Verify product images appear as thumbnails
- Check that mailto: and tel: links work in Slack
- Confirm primary button styling

### 4. Test Real Alert Flow

1. Enable lead capture in widget
2. Have a test customer complete a conversation
3. Click on product recommendations
4. Submit lead form with all fields
5. Verify alert includes:
   - ✅ Actual lead contact info
   - ✅ Products that were shown/clicked
   - ✅ Real conversation summary

### 5. Test Without Products

1. Create a session without product recommendations
2. Submit lead form
3. Verify alert still works gracefully without products section

### 6. Test Without Consent

1. Submit lead form without checking consent
2. Verify PII is redacted as `[REDACTED]`
3. Verify products are still shown (not PII)

       ↓
enqueueAlert() creates Alert record

       ↓
redactPII() if no consent
       ↓
Send via channel (email/SMS/Slack)
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why No Prices?
- Prices can change frequently
- May cause confusion if outdated
- Focus on product interest, not pricing
- Retailer can see current pricing in Shopify

### Why 3 Products Max?
- Keeps emails/alerts concise
- Most important products are recent ones
- Prevents information overload
- SMS has strict character limits

### Why Deduplicate Products?
- Same product may be shown multiple times
- Only show once with "clicked" status if ever clicked
- Cleaner, more actionable alerts

### Why tel: and mailto: Links?
- One-click action from mobile devices
- Immediate response capability
- Better user experience for retailers
- Industry standard for contact links

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### No Database Changes Required
- Uses existing tables (Lead, Event, ProductProfile)
- No migrations needed
- Backward compatible

### No Environment Variables Required
- Uses existing SendGrid/Twilio credentials
- Works with current configuration

### Immediate Effect
- Changes apply to all new alerts
- Existing queued alerts will get enriched data
- No restart needed (Node.js hot reload)

---

## 📈 Expected Impact

### For Retailers
- ✅ Faster response times (no Shopify login needed)
- ✅ Better lead context (products + conversation)
- ✅ One-click call/email from mobile
- ✅ Visual indicators for high-intent products

### For Conversion Rates
- ✅ Quicker follow-up = higher conversion
- ✅ Product context = better conversations
- ✅ Phone visibility = more calls
- ✅ Professional presentation = trust

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Product images not displaying in email
**Solution:** Verify ProductProfile.imageUrl is set and publicly accessible

### Issue: SMS message truncated
**Solution:** Product titles are limited to 40 chars; this is expected

### Issue: Slack images not showing
**Solution:** Image URLs must be HTTPS and publicly accessible

### Issue: No products in alert
**Solution:** Normal if no recommendations were shown/clicked in session

### Issue: [REDACTED] in alerts
**Solution:** This is correct behavior when consent=false (GDPR)
