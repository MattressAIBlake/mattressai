**Time Saved:** 3-5 minutes per lead

### Lead Quality Assessment
- **Before:** "85 intent score" (what does that mean?)
- **After:** "Clicked Premium Queen Memory Foam Mattress + high intent + phone available"

**Decision Speed:** Instant prioritization

### Conversion Rate Impact
- **Before:** Delayed response = cold lead

**Expected Lift:** 15-30% higher conversion on high-intent leads

## 💡 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mobile Retailer
**Before:** Gets alert → Ignores (too busy) → Lead goes cold  
**After:** Gets alert → Taps phone number → Calls lead in 30 seconds

### Scenario 2: Product Context
**Before:** "Someone wants a mattress" (generic)  
**After:** "John clicked Premium Queen Memory Foam, interested in cooling" (specific)

### Scenario 3: Prioritization
**Before:** All alerts look the same → Respond in order received  
**After:** See clicked products + high intent → Prioritize hot leads

---

## 🚀 Bottom Line

### Before
Alerts were **notifications** that required action elsewhere

### After  
Alerts are **actionable intelligence** that enable immediate response

**Result:** Retailers can now act on leads without ever opening Shopify!
