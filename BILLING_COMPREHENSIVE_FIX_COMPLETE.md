**Commit**: `47606cb`  
**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: **Ready for Testing**

---

## üéØ Problems Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **"Cannot accept charge" error** when clicking Cancel or trying to upgrade with existing subscription
2. ‚úÖ **No visibility** into actual Shopify subscription status
3. ‚úÖ **No way to cancel** existing subscriptions
4. ‚úÖ **Can't change plans** (upgrade/downgrade between paid plans)
5. ‚úÖ **Database/Shopify state mismatch** - only showed database state, not real billing

---

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Added Subscription Cancellation (`app/lib/billing/billing.service.ts`)

**New Function**: `cancelSubscription()`
```typescript
export async function cancelSubscription(shop: string, admin: any, subscriptionId: string)
```

- Calls Shopify's `appSubscriptionCancel` mutation
- Properly handles errors with userErrors
- Returns cancelled subscription details

### 2. Enhanced Plans Page Loader (`app/routes/app.admin.plans/route.jsx`)

**Now Fetches Real Shopify Data**:
- Calls `getActiveSubscription()` to get actual subscription from Shopify
- Passes subscription details to frontend:
  - Subscription ID
  - Plan name
  - Status (ACTIVE/CANCELLED/etc)
  - Is test mode
  - Price per month
- Shows real-time billing state, not just database cache

### 3. Improved Plans Page Action (`app/routes/app.admin.plans/route.jsx`)

**New "cancel" Action**:
- Cancels subscription in Shopify
- Downgrades tenant to starter plan
- Shows success message
- Reloads page to show updated state

**Enhanced "upgrade" Action**:
- **Checks for existing active subscription FIRST**
- If subscription exists with same price ‚Üí shows error "Already subscribed"
- If subscription exists with different price ‚Üí **cancels old, creates new**
- Waits 1 second after cancellation before creating new subscription
- Prevents "cannot accept charge" errors

### 4. Updated Plans Page UI (`app/routes/app.admin.plans/route.jsx`)

**New Features**:
- Shows active subscription details with badges:
  - "Active Subscription" (green)
  - "Test Mode" (warning) if in test mode
- Displays subscription price and name below plan
- **"Cancel Subscription" button** (red) for paid plans
- Button text changes:
  - "Upgrade Plan" when no subscription
  - "Change Plan" when active subscription exists
- Confirmation dialog before cancellation
- Better error/success banners

**Visual Enhancements**:
- Badges show subscription state at a glance
- Test mode clearly indicated
- Cancel button uses critical tone (red)
- Proper spacing and alignment

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Test Mode**: In development (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`), subscriptions are created in test mode. No actual charges occur.

2. **Timing**: There's a 1-second delay after cancelling old subscription before creating new one. This gives Shopify time to process the cancellation.

3. **State Sync**: Loader now always fetches from Shopify, so you see real-time billing state, not cached database state.

4. **Error Handling**: All GraphQL errors are caught and shown to the user with clear messages.

5. **Webhooks**: The existing `app_subscriptions/update` webhook still handles external cancellations (when user cancels via Shopify admin).

## üìÅ Files Modified

- `app/routes/app.admin.plans/route.jsx` - Complete overhaul of loader, action, and UI
