# üö® CRITICAL: GitHub is Deploying to Wrong Vercel Project

## Problem
The GitHub repo `MattressAIBlake/mattressai` is connected to BOTH:
- ‚ùå **OLD PROJECT**: `mattressai` (wrong one)
- ‚úÖ **NEW PROJECT**: `mattressaishopify` (correct one)

When you push to GitHub, it auto-deploys to the OLD project instead of the new one.

---

## ‚úÖ PERMANENT FIX

### Step 1: Disconnect Old Vercel Project

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/blake-austins-projects/mattressai/settings/git**
2. Click **"Disconnect"** to unlink it from GitHub
3. Confirm the disconnection

### Step 2: Verify New Project is Connected

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/blake-austins-projects/mattressaishopify/settings/git**
2. Verify it shows:
   - ‚úÖ Connected to: `github.com/MattressAIBlake/mattressai`
   - ‚úÖ Branch: `main`
   - ‚úÖ Auto-deploy: Enabled

### Step 3: Trigger Manual Deployment (Right Now)

Since the latest push went to the wrong project, manually deploy to the correct one:

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/blake-austins-projects/mattressaishopify/deployments**
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. OR click the "..." menu ‚Üí **"Redeploy WITHOUT Cache"**

---

## üìã Going Forward

After disconnecting the old project, all GitHub pushes will ONLY deploy to `mattressaishopify` ‚úÖ

---

## üîç Quick Check

To verify which project is deploying:
- Watch: https://vercel.com/blake-austins-projects
- After a git push, ONLY `mattressaishopify` should show "Building..."
- If `mattressai` also shows "Building...", the disconnect didn't work
