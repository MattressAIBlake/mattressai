```

## üìã Next Steps to Test Live

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (if not already)
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete billing setup with Shopify native integration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy from your GitHub repo.

### 2. Install on Test Store
1. Go to Shopify Partners dashboard
2. Open your app
3. Click "Test on development store"

7. You'll return to the Plans page
8. Verify your plan shows as "Pro"

### 4. Verify Database Update
Check the database to confirm the upgrade:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Look for your tenant record:
- `planName` should be "pro"
- `billingId` should have the subscription ID
- `quotas` should show Pro limits

### 5. Test Webhook (Optional)
In Shopify Partners:
1. Go to App Setup ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Find the `app_subscriptions/update` webhook
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Check server logs for processing

### 6. Test Cancellation

### Expected Revenue (Estimates)
- 100 users: 80 free, 15 pro, 5 enterprise
  - Revenue: (15 √ó $49) + (5 √ó $199) = $1,730/mo
