**Status:** Pre-Submission Review  
**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Your app has a **strong foundation** with advanced features (Phase 1-5 complete). However, there are **critical gaps** that MUST be addressed before Shopify App Store submission. This document provides a complete checklist and action plan.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Submission**

### 1. Privacy Policy & Legal Pages ‚ùå

**Status:** MISSING - BLOCKERS FOR SUBMISSION

**Required:**
- [ ] Privacy Policy URL (public, accessible without login)
- [ ] Terms of Service URL (recommended)
- [ ] Support/Contact URL or email

**Why it matters:** Shopify requires a privacy policy URL during app listing creation. Without it, you cannot complete the submission form.

**Action Plan:**

#### Option A: Create Static Pages (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a simple static site with:
# - /privacy
# - /terms
# - /support

# Host on:
# - GitHub Pages (free)
# - Vercel static site (free)
# - Your own domain
```

#### Option B: Use Privacy Policy Generator
1. Use: https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy-policy-generator/ or https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/
2. Include sections for:
   - **Data Collection:** Email, phone, name, ZIP, chat messages, product views, cart actions
   - **Third-Party Services:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, embeddings), Pinecone (vector storage), SendGrid (emails), Twilio (SMS), Shopify APIs
   - **Data Usage:** AI recommendations, lead capture, analytics, A/B testing
   - **Data Retention:** How long you keep data
   - **GDPR Rights:** Access, deletion, portability, objection
   - **Cookies:** Session tracking, analytics
   - **Contact:** support@your-domain.com

#### Option C: Hire a Lawyer
- For production apps handling customer PII, consider legal review
- Cost: $500-$2000 for privacy policy + terms

**Minimum Viable Privacy Policy Template:**
```markdown

### 2. Complete GDPR Webhook Implementation ‚ùå

**Status:** PLACEHOLDER CODE - FUNCTIONAL BUT INCOMPLETE

**Current State:**
```javascript
// app/routes/webhooks.customers.data_request/route.jsx
// TODO: Implement actual data export for customer

// app/routes/webhooks.customers.redact/route.jsx  
// TODO: Implement actual customer data deletion
```

**Why it matters:** Shopify tests GDPR webhooks during review. Non-functional implementations will result in rejection.

**What needs to be implemented:**

```javascript
// Must export ALL customer data in machine-readable format
// Include:
// - ChatSession records
// - Lead records
// - Event records
// - Alert records
// - Conversation messages
```

#### B. Customer Redact (Delete)
```javascript
// Must delete or anonymize ALL customer PII
// Tables affected:
// - ChatSession (set consent=false, clear summary if contains PII)
// - Lead (delete record or anonymize email/phone/name/zip)
// - Event (anonymize if metadata contains PII)
// - Alert (anonymize payload if contains PII)
// - Message (delete if contains customer PII)
```

#### C. Shop Redact (Delete All Shop Data)
```javascript
// Must delete ALL data for the shop
// Tables affected:
// - All ChatSession records for tenantId
// - All Lead records for tenantId
// - All Alert records for tenantId
// - All Event records for tenantId
// - AlertSettings for tenantId
// - PromptVersion for tenantId
// - IndexJob for tenantId
// - ProductProfile for tenantId
// - Experiment for tenantId
// - Tenant record
```

**Implementation Required:**

    data: {
      leads,
      sessions,
      messages,
      events: sessions.flatMap(s => s.events),
      alerts: sessions.flatMap(s => s.alerts)

      sessionId: { in: sessionIds }
    }
  });

  // Delete events with customer metadata
  await prisma.event.deleteMany({
    where: {
      sessionId: { in: sessionIds }
    }
  });

  console.log(`[GDPR] Redacted customer ${customerId} for shop ${shopId}`);
};

export const redactShopData = async (shopId: string) => {
  // Delete all data for shop in correct order (respecting foreign keys)
  await prisma.alert.deleteMany({ where: { tenantId: shopId } });
  await prisma.event.deleteMany({ where: { tenantId: shopId } });
  await prisma.lead.deleteMany({ where: { tenantId: shopId } });
  await prisma.chatSession.deleteMany({ where: { tenantId: shopId } });
