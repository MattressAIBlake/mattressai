# Product URL Implementation - Complete âœ…

## Summary
Successfully implemented Option 1: Store product URLs in the database during indexing. The "View Product" button on product cards will now work correctly once products are re-indexed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema âœ…
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `productUrl String?` field to `ProductProfile` model (after `imageUrl`)
- Added index `@@index([productUrl])` for efficient queries

### 2. Product Indexer âœ…
**File**: `app/workers/indexer.ts`
- Line 849: Added `productUrl: product.onlineStoreUrl || null` to store URL during product creation
- Line 744: Vector metadata already includes `product_url: product.onlineStoreUrl || ''`
- GraphQL query already fetches `onlineStoreUrl` (line 491)

### 3. Webhook Handler âœ…
**File**: `app/routes/webhooks.products.update/route.tsx`
- Lines 144-148: Added `onlineStoreUrl` and `featuredImage` to GraphQL query
- Lines 106-161: Updated to upsert ProductProfile with `productUrl` field
- Lines 173-174: Added `image_url` and `product_url` to vector metadata

### 4. Catalog Indexing Route âœ…
**File**: `app/routes/app.admin.catalog-indexing/route.jsx`
- Lines 258-259: Added `image_url` and `product_url` to vector metadata (critical field updates)
- Lines 282-283: Added `image_url` and `product_url` to vector metadata (non-critical updates)

### 5. MCP Client âœ…
**File**: `app/mcp-client.js`
- Line 414: Added `url: product.url` to formatted results mapping

### 6. Tool Service âœ…
**File**: `app/services/tool.server.js`
- Line 118: Already includes `url: product.url || ''` in formatProductData âœ“ (No changes needed)

### 7. Recommendation Service âœ…
**File**: `app/lib/recommendations/recommendation.service.server.ts`
- Line 337: Already includes `url: metadata.product_url` âœ“ (No changes needed)
- Line 55: RecommendedProduct interface already has `url?: string` field âœ“

### 8. Database Migration âœ…
**File**: `prisma/migrations/20251023234506_add_product_url_to_profile/migration.sql`
- Created migration to add `productUrl` column
- Added index on `productUrl` for performance

## Data Flow

The product URL now flows through the entire system:

```
Shopify Product (onlineStoreUrl)
    â†“
Product Indexer â†’ Stores in ProductProfile.productUrl
    â†“
Vector Store â†’ Stores in metadata.product_url
    â†“
Recommendation Service â†’ Reads from metadata.product_url
    â†“
MCP Client â†’ Passes url field
    â†“
Tool Service â†’ Includes url in product data
    â†“
Widget â†’ Uses product.url for "View Product" button
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- [x] Schema updated with productUrl field
- [x] Migration file created
- [x] All vector upsert operations include product_url
- [x] All data pipeline updated
- [x] No linting errors

### Post-Deployment Testing (Required)
- [ ] **Deploy to production** - Push changes and deploy
- [ ] **Run migration** - Prisma will auto-apply the migration on deployment
- [ ] **Re-index products** - Go to Admin â†’ Catalog Indexing and trigger a full re-index
- [ ] **Verify URL storage** - Check that ProductProfile records have productUrl populated
- [ ] **Test recommendations** - Trigger product recommendations in the widget
- [ ] **Test "View Product" button** - Click button and verify it navigates to correct product page
- [ ] **Test on custom domain** - Verify URLs work correctly (not just myshopify.com)

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add productUrl to ProductProfile and update data pipeline

- Add productUrl field to ProductProfile schema
- Store onlineStoreUrl during product indexing
- Include product_url in vector metadata across all upsert operations
- Pass URL through recommendation service to widget
- Fixes 'View Product' button not working on product cards"

git push origin main
```

### 2. Apply Migration (Automatic on Vercel)
When you deploy to Vercel, Prisma will automatically detect and apply the new migration during the build process. No manual intervention needed.

### 3. Re-index Existing Products
**Important**: Existing products in the database won't have URLs until they're re-indexed.

Steps:
1. Log into your admin panel
2. Navigate to **Admin â†’ Catalog Indexing**
3. Click **"Start Full Re-index"**
4. Monitor progress until completion
5. Verify products now have URLs in the database

### 4. Verify in Widget
1. Open your storefront with the widget
2. Start a chat and get product recommendations
3. Click "View Product" button on any product card
4. Verify it opens the correct product page

## Technical Notes

### Why This Approach?
- **Clean & Maintainable**: Follows existing pattern (similar to imageUrl)
- **Performant**: URL readily available, no runtime processing needed
- **Reliable**: Single source of truth in database
- **Scalable**: No additional API calls or URL construction logic

### URL Format
Shopify's `onlineStoreUrl` returns the full product URL:
- Example: `https://shop-name.myshopify.com/products/product-handle`
- Works on custom domains when used as relative path `/products/product-handle`
- Widget code already handles URL conversion (line 793-801 in widget route)

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing products without URLs will show `#` as href (non-breaking)
- After re-indexing, all products will have proper URLs
- No downtime or errors during migration

## Files Modified

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added productUrl field and index
2. `app/workers/indexer.ts` - Store URL during indexing
3. `app/routes/webhooks.products.update/route.tsx` - Fetch and store URL on updates
4. `app/routes/app.admin.catalog-indexing/route.jsx` - Include URL in vector metadata
5. `app/mcp-client.js` - Pass URL through to formatted results
6. `prisma/migrations/20251023234506_add_product_url_to_profile/migration.sql` - Database migration

## Success Criteria

âœ… Database schema updated
âœ… Migration created
âœ… Indexer stores URLs
âœ… Webhooks include URLs
âœ… Vector metadata includes URLs
âœ… Recommendation service passes URLs
âœ… MCP client includes URLs
âœ… No linting errors

ðŸ”² Migration applied in production (automatic on deploy)
ðŸ”² Products re-indexed
ðŸ”² "View Product" button works in widget

---

**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Deployment ðŸš€

**Next Action**: Deploy to production, then re-index products to populate URLs.
