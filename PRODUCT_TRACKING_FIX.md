# Product Tracking Fix - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Fixed and Deployed

---

## 🐛 The Problem

The "Top Products" analytics dashboard was showing no data because product recommendation events were never being tracked.

### Root Cause

The `MattressAITracking` module in `tracking.js` was loaded but **never initialized**. This meant:
- ❌ No event listeners were set up for `recommendation_shown`
- ❌ No event listeners were set up for `recommendation_clicked`
- ❌ No event listeners were set up for `add_to_cart`
- ❌ Widget was dispatching events but nobody was listening
- ❌ No tracking data reached the backend

---

## ✅ The Fix

**File**: `app/routes/apps.mattressai.widget[.]js/route.jsx`

Added tracking initialization in the widget's `init()` function (lines 98-104):

```javascript
// Initialize tracking module
if (window.MattressAITracking) {
  window.MattressAITracking.init(this.config.tenant, '/apps/mattressai');
  console.log('MattressAI Tracking initialized');
} else {
  console.warn('MattressAI Tracking module not found');
}
```

This initializes the tracking module which:
1. ✅ Sets up event listeners for all tracking events
2. ✅ Tracks `widget_viewed` on page load
3. ✅ Tracks `recommendation_shown` when products are displayed
4. ✅ Tracks `recommendation_clicked` when "View Product" is clicked
5. ✅ Tracks `add_to_cart` when products are added (with attribution via clickId)
6. ✅ Sends all events to `/apps/mattressai/event` endpoint

---

## 🔄 How Product Tracking Works Now

### Event Flow

1. **Widget loads on storefront**
   - `tracking.js` loads asynchronously from Shopify assets
   - Widget initializes and calls `MattressAITracking.init()`

2. **Recommendations shown**
   - Widget displays product cards
   - Dispatches `mattressai:recommendation_shown` event for each product
   - Tracking module listens and sends to backend with metadata:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "recommendation_shown",
       "metadata": {
         "productId": "12345",
         "productTitle": "Queen Mattress",
         "productPrice": 999.99
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Customer clicks "View Product"**
   - Widget dispatches `mattressai:recommendation_clicked` event
   - Tracking module generates unique `clickId` for attribution
   - Stores `clickId` in sessionStorage for the product
   - Sends event to backend with clickId

4. **Customer adds to cart**
   - Shopify triggers `product:added-to-cart` or cart fetch intercepted
   - Tracking module retrieves stored `clickId` for that product
   - Sends `add_to_cart` event with clickId for attribution

5. **Analytics dashboard aggregates**
   - Backend service queries Event table
   - Groups by productId
   - Counts: recommended → clicked → added to cart → ordered
   - Calculates conversion rates
   - Displays in "Top Products" section

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### Event Types
| Event | When | Metadata |
|-------|------|----------|
| `widget_viewed` | Page loads with widget | - |
| `opened` | Chat bubble clicked | - |
| `first_message` | User sends first message | - |
| `data_point_captured` | AI captures preference | `questionType` |
| `recommendation_shown` | Product displayed | `productId`, `productTitle`, `productPrice` |
| `recommendation_clicked` | "View Product" clicked | `productId`, `productTitle`, `productPrice`, `clickId` |
| `add_to_cart` | Product added to cart | `productId`, `variantId`, `clickId` |
| `checkout_started` | Checkout page loaded | - |
| `order_placed` | Thank you page loaded | `orderId`, attribution |

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE Event (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId TEXT NOT NULL,
  sessionId TEXT,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  metadata TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON string
  clickId TEXT,            -- For attribution
  variantId TEXT,          -- Product variant
  INDEX idx_tenant (tenantId),
  INDEX idx_session (sessionId),
  INDEX idx_type (type),
  INDEX idx_timestamp (timestamp),
  INDEX idx_clickId (clickId),
  INDEX idx_variantId (variantId)
);
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### 1. Check Console Logs (Browser DevTools)
After the fix, you should see in the browser console:
```
✅ MattressAI: widget.js loaded successfully
✅ MattressAI: Calling init()...
✅ MattressAI Tracking initialized
✅ MattressAI Widget initialized
```

### 2. Verify Tracking Events Sent
Open Network tab and filter for `/apps/mattressai/event`:
- Should see POST requests when recommendations are shown
- Should see POST requests when "View Product" is clicked
- Response should be: `{"ok": true, "type": "recommendation_shown", "timestamp": "..."}`

### 3. Check Database
```sql
-- Check if events are being recorded
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM Event
WHERE tenantId = 'your-shop.myshopify.com'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Check product tracking specifically
SELECT 
  JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.productTitle') as product,
  type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM Event
WHERE tenantId = 'your-shop.myshopify.com'
  AND type IN ('recommendation_shown', 'recommendation_clicked', 'add_to_cart')
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY product, type
ORDER BY product, type;
```

### 4. Check Analytics Dashboard
1. Go to Analytics Dashboard in admin
2. Select date range (last 7 or 30 days)
3. Scroll to "Top Products" section
4. Should see products with:
   - Recommended count
   - Clicked count
   - Added to Cart count
   - Ordered count
   - Conversion rate %

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Top Products: Empty or "No product data available yet"
- Event table: Only `widget_viewed`, `opened`, `first_message` events
- No product attribution

### After Fix
- Top Products: Shows actual product performance data
- Event table: All event types including `recommendation_shown`, `recommendation_clicked`, `add_to_cart`
- Full attribution from recommendation → click → cart → order

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No events showing up?

**Check 1**: Is `tracking.js` loaded?
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(window.MattressAITracking);
// Should show: {init: ƒ, setupListeners: ƒ, track: ƒ, ...}
```

**Check 2**: Was tracking initialized?
Look for `"MattressAI Tracking initialized"` in console logs

**Check 3**: Are events being dispatched?
```javascript
// Add temporary listener in console:
document.addEventListener('mattressai:recommendation_shown', (e) => {
  console.log('Recommendation shown event:', e.detail);
});
```

**Check 4**: Check for JavaScript errors
Open console and look for any errors that might prevent initialization

### Events sent but not in database?

**Check 1**: Verify API endpoint is working
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/apps/mattressai/event \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": "your-shop.myshopify.com",
    "type": "test_event",
    "metadata": {}
  }'
```

**Check 2**: Check server logs in Vercel
Look for errors in the `/apps/mattressai/event` route

**Check 3**: Rate limiting
Maximum 100 events per minute per tenant. Check if limit exceeded:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Event 
WHERE tenantId = 'shop' 
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute';
```
