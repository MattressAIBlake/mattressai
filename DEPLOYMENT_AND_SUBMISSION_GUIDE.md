## Part 2: Database Migration

### Step 4: Apply Migrations to Development

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/blakeaustin/Desktop/mattressaishopify

# Run migrations
npm run setup

# Or manually:
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": SQLite database "dev.sqlite" at "file:dev.sqlite"

Applying migration `20251006201529_add_phase5_ab_testing_billing`

...

‚úî Generated Prisma Client
```

### Step 5: Seed Billing Plans

node --loader ts-node/esm app/lib/billing/seed-plans.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üå± Seeding billing plans...
‚úÖ Billing plans seeded successfully
```

**Verify in Database:**
```bash
# Open Prisma Studio to verify
npx prisma studio

# Navigate to:
# - Plan table (should have 3 records: starter, pro, enterprise)
# - Tenant table (should exist but may be empty until first install)
```

## Part 3: Local Testing

### Step 6: Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# This will:

```

**Expected Output:**
```
Using shopify.app.toml:
  ‚îî‚îÄ from: /Users/blakeaustin/Desktop/mattressaishopify

  Partners account: Your Account
  Organization:     Your Org
  App:              MattressAI

nano .env.production.example
```

**Required Variables:**
```bash
# Shopify
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_production_secret
SCOPES=write_products,read_customers,write_orders,etc

# Database (if using remote DB)

PINECONE_INDEX=your_production_index

# Billing (production values)
BILLING_ENABLED=true
BILLING_STARTER_PRICE=0
BILLING_PRO_PRICE=49
BILLING_ENTERPRISE_PRICE=199
BILLING_TRIAL_DAYS=14

# i18n
STOREFRONT_I18N_ENABLED=true

```

#### Option B: Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# Set environment variables via Railway dashboard
```

#### Option C: Render

1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run setup && npm run build`

fly ssh console -a mattressai-shopify
npm run setup

# Option 2: Railway
railway run npm run setup

# Option 3: Render
# Use the Shell tab in Render dashboard
npm run setup
```

**If using SQLite (not recommended for production):**
- Ensure `prisma/dev.sqlite` is included in deployment
- Or switch to PostgreSQL for production

### Step 13: Seed Plans in Production

```bash
# Via your hosting platform's console:

# Fly.io
fly ssh console -a mattressai-shopify
npx tsx app/lib/billing/seed-plans.ts

# Railway
railway run npx tsx app/lib/billing/seed-plans.ts

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Migrations Fail in Production

```bash
# Check database connection
fly ssh console -a mattressai-shopify
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Manually run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma

# If using SQLite, ensure file persists:
# Add volume in fly.toml:
# [mounts]
#   source = "data"
#   destination = "/app/prisma"
```

### Issue 2: App Proxy Not Working

**Symptoms:** 404 on `/apps/mattressai/*` routes

**Fix:**
1. Verify proxy configuration in Partners Dashboard
2. Ensure `verifyProxyHmac` is not failing (check logs)
3. Test with: `curl https://your-store.myshopify.com/apps/mattressai/session/start`

### Issue 3: Theme Extension Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Widget doesn't show on storefront

**Fix:**
1. Verify extension is deployed: `npm run deploy`
2. Check if it's enabled in Theme Editor
3. Verify liquid syntax in `app-embed.liquid`
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue 4: Billing Not Working

**Symptoms:** Upgrade button doesn't redirect

**Fix:**
1. Verify billing configuration in Partners Dashboard
2. Check if app is approved for billing (test mode vs live)
3. Ensure shop has payment method on file
4. Check billing webhook endpoint is accessible

### Issue 5: High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:** App crashes or slow performance

**Fix:**
```bash
# Identify memory leaks
fly logs -a mattressai-shopify | grep "memory"

# Optimize database queries (add indexes)
# Check for missing `.limit()` on queries
# Use connection pooling
# Implement caching (Redis)
```
