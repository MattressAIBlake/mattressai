# CRM Integrations Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented Twilio verification and dedicated CRM integrations for Podium and Birdeye platforms.

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. Podium Integration Service

- Handles API errors gracefully

**Payload Format:**
```typescript
{
  locationId: string,
  contactFirstName: string,
  contactLastName: string,
  contactPhone?: string,
  contactEmail?: string,
  source: "MattressAI",
  customFields?: {
    intentScore: number,
    sessionSummary: string,
    mattressAiSessionId: string
  }
}
```

### 2. Birdeye Integration Service
**File:** `app/lib/integrations/birdeye.service.ts`

- Direct customer submission to Birdeye CRM
- Transforms MattressAI lead data into Birdeye's expected format
- Supports custom attributes (intentScore, sessionSummary, sessionId)
- Includes test connection function
- Handles API errors gracefully

**Payload Format:**
```typescript
{
  businessId: string,
  customerFirstName: string,
  customerLastName: string,
  customerEmail?: string,
  customerPhoneNumber?: string,
  source: "MattressAI",
  customAttributes?: {
    intentScore: string,
    sessionSummary: string,
    mattressAiSessionId: string
  }
}
```

### 3. Extended Alert System
**File:** `app/lib/alerts/alert.service.ts`

**Added:**
- Import statements for Podium and Birdeye services
- New case handlers for 'podium' and 'birdeye' channels

- **Flexible API Keys:** Supports both global env var keys and per-tenant config keys
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for missing credentials or leads

### 4. Admin Test Interface
**File:** `app/routes/app.admin.integrations.test/route.jsx`

Beautiful Shopify Polaris UI for testing all integrations:

**Features:**
- Test Twilio SMS (with phone number input)
- Test Podium integration (with Location ID and API Key inputs)
- Test Birdeye integration (with Business ID and API Key inputs)
- Real-time success/error feedback
- Helpful documentation sidebar
- Loading states during submission

**Access:** `/app/admin/integrations/test`

## üîß Configuration Guide

### Per-Merchant Configuration

Merchants configure CRM integrations in their alert settings:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "podium": {
      "locationId": "merchant-podium-location-id",
      "apiKey": "merchant-podium-api-key"
    },
    "birdeye": {
      "businessId": "merchant-birdeye-business-id",
      "apiKey": "merchant-birdeye-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Configuration (Optional)

For shared API keys across all merchants (not recommended):

```bash
PODIUM_API_KEY=shared_key
BIRDEYE_API_KEY=shared_key
```

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Twilio SMS
1. Set Twilio env vars in Vercel
2. Navigate to `/app/admin/integrations/test`
3. Enter test phone number
4. Click "Send Test SMS"
5. Verify SMS received

### Podium Integration
1. Get Podium Location ID from Podium dashboard
2. Get Podium API Key from Podium dashboard
3. Navigate to `/app/admin/integrations/test`
4. Enter credentials
5. Click "Send Test Lead to Podium"
6. Verify lead appears in Podium

### Birdeye Integration
1. Get Birdeye Business ID from Birdeye dashboard
2. Get Birdeye API Key from Birdeye dashboard
3. Navigate to `/app/admin/integrations/test`
4. Enter credentials
5. Click "Send Test Lead to Birdeye"
6. Verify customer appears in Birdeye

## üöÄ How It Works (End-to-End)

1. **User captures lead** ‚Üí Lead form submitted via `/apps/mattressai/lead`
2. **Lead created** ‚Üí Stored in database with `consent` flag
3. **Session ends** ‚Üí `endSession()` called with `endReason: 'converted'`
4. **Alert enqueued** ‚Üí Alert type `lead_captured` created for enabled channels
5. **Alert worker processes** ‚Üí Background worker picks up queued alerts
6. **Channel routing** ‚Üí Alert sent to configured channels (email, SMS, Podium, Birdeye, etc.)
7. **CRM integration** ‚Üí If Podium/Birdeye enabled and consent=true, lead sent to CRM
8. **Merchant notified** ‚Üí Merchant sees notification and lead in their CRM

## üîí GDPR Compliance

Both Podium and Birdeye integrations enforce GDPR compliance:

```typescript
if (!consent) {
  throw new Error('Cannot send lead to [CRM] without user consent (GDPR compliance)');
}
```

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Leads are only sent to external systems with explicit user consent
- ‚úÖ No PII is shared without permission
- ‚úÖ Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations

## üì¶ Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/lib/integrations/podium.service.ts` (123 lines)

**Modified Files:**

## üéâ Deployment

Changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
Commit: 157cfb7
Message: feat: Add Twilio verification and Podium/Birdeye CRM integrations
Branch: main
Status: Pushed to origin
```

Vercel will automatically deploy these changes to production.

## üìù Next Steps for Merchant

1. **Set up Twilio:**
   - Create Twilio account
   - Purchase phone number
   - Add credentials to Vercel env vars
   - Test via admin interface

2. **Set up Podium (if desired):**
   - Get Podium account with API access
   - Retrieve Location ID and API Key
   - Configure in Alert Settings or test interface
   - Enable `lead_captured` trigger with Podium channel

3. **Set up Birdeye (if desired):**
   - Get Birdeye account with API access
   - Retrieve Business ID and API Key
   - Configure in Alert Settings or test interface
   - Enable `lead_captured` trigger with Birdeye channel

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Twilio fails:**
- Check env vars are set in Vercel
- Verify phone number has SMS capability
- Check Twilio account balance

**Podium fails:**
- Verify Location ID is correct
- Check API Key has proper permissions
- Ensure lead has email or phone (required by Podium)

**Birdeye fails:**
- Verify Business ID is correct
- Check API Key has proper permissions
- Ensure lead has email or phone (required by Birdeye)

**No leads sent to CRM:**
- Check `consent` flag is true on lead
- Verify channel is enabled in Alert Settings
- Check alert was created and not throttled
- Run alert worker to process queued alerts

## üí° Technical Notes

- API calls use native `fetch()` (no external dependencies)
- Retry logic handled by existing alert worker (max 3 attempts)
- Test functions include real API calls (use with caution)
- Errors logged to console for debugging
- Per-tenant configuration stored in AlertSettings.channels
- Global API keys optional (can use per-tenant keys only)
