# Debug: Buttons Not Triggering Network Requests

## Issue
Clicking "Upgrade" buttons on billing page does nothing - no network requests appear.

## Root Cause
This means JavaScript is failing BEFORE the form submission happens.

## Step 1: Check Console for JavaScript Errors

1. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to **Console** tab (not Network)
3. Clear the console
4. Click "Upgrade to Pro" button
5. **Look for RED error messages**

### Common JavaScript Errors:

#### Error 1: "submit is not defined"
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: submit is not defined
```
**Fix**: Submit function not imported properly

#### Error 2: "Cannot read properties of undefined"
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'submit')
```
**Fix**: useSubmit hook not working

#### Error 3: Shopify App Bridge Error
```
Error: App Bridge initialization failed
```
**Fix**: App Bridge not properly configured

## Step 2: Check if Page is Fully Loaded

The billing page might not be rendering correctly. Check:

1. Do you see the upgrade buttons?
2. Do you see your current plan?
3. Do you see usage metrics?
4. Is the page layout correct?

If the page looks broken or empty, there's a rendering error.

## Step 3: Test if ANY Network Requests Work

1. Reload the page
2. Check Network tab
3. Do you see the page load request: `GET /app/admin/plans`?

If NO requests show up at all:
- DevTools might not be recording
- Check "Preserve log" is unchecked
- Try closing/reopening DevTools

## Step 4: Inspect the Button Element

1. Right-click on "Upgrade to Pro" button
2. Click "Inspect Element"
3. Look at the button HTML

Should look like:
```html
<button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>Upgrade to Pro</button>
```

Or:
```html
<form method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="planName" value="pro" />
  <button type="submit">Upgrade to Pro</button>
</form>
```

## Quick Test: Try Clicking Different Buttons

Try clicking:
- The top "Upgrade Plan" button
- "Upgrade to Pro" button on Pro card
- "Upgrade to Enterprise" button on Enterprise card

Do ANY of them work?
