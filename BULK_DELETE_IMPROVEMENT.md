# Bulk Delete Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the "Current Inventory" table in the Product Inventory page with a comprehensive bulk delete feature, making it significantly easier to manage and remove multiple products at once.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Selection Checkboxes**
- Added a checkbox column as the first column in the table
- Each product row has an individual checkbox for selection
- Checkbox state is tracked in component state

### 2. **Select All Functionality**
- Added a checkbox in the table header to select/deselect all products on the current page
- Visual indicator shows when all products are selected
- Intelligently handles partial selections

### 3. **Bulk Action Banner**
- Displays a prominent info banner when products are selected
- Shows count of selected products (e.g., "3 products selected")
- Includes a "Delete Selected" button in the banner
- Dismissable with an X button to clear selections

### 4. **Bulk Delete Confirmation Modal**
- Shows a detailed confirmation dialog before bulk deletion
- Lists the first 10 products to be deleted with their titles and vendors
- Shows "...and X more" if more than 10 products are selected
- Clearly states the action is irreversible
- Destructive action styling for safety

### 5. **Backend Bulk Delete Handler**
- New `bulkDeleteProducts` action in the backend
- Uses Prisma transactions for atomic PostgreSQL deletions
- Batch deletes from Pinecone vector store
- Returns success message with count of deleted products

### 6. **Smart Selection Management**
- Selections automatically clear after successful deletion
- Selections clear when changing pages (prevents confusion)
- Selections clear when applying filters or searching
- Prevents selection state from persisting across different views

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users had to delete products one by one
- Each deletion required:
  1. Click "Delete" button
  2. Confirm deletion
  3. Wait for deletion
  4. Repeat for each product
- Time-consuming for managing large inventories

### After
- Users can delete multiple products in one action
- Workflow:
  1. Check boxes next to products to delete (or use "Select All")
  2. Click "Delete Selected" in the banner
  3. Review the list and confirm once
  4. All selected products deleted simultaneously
- Significantly faster for bulk operations

## Technical Details

### State Management
```javascript
const [selectedProducts, setSelectedProducts] = useState([]);
const [showBulkDeleteConfirm, setShowBulkDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
```

### Selection Handlers
- `handleSelectProduct(productId)` - Toggle individual selection
- `handleSelectAll(checked)` - Select/deselect all on page
- `handleBulkDelete()` - Open confirmation modal
- `handleConfirmBulkDelete()` - Execute bulk deletion

### Backend Action
```javascript
if (actionType === 'bulkDeleteProducts') {
  const products = JSON.parse(formData.get('productsData'));
  
  // Delete from PostgreSQL (transactional)
  await prisma.$transaction(
    products.map(product => 
      prisma.productProfile.delete({ where: { id: product.id } })
    )
  );
  
  // Delete from Pinecone
  const pineconeIds = products.map(p => `product-${p.shopifyProductId}`);
  await vectorStoreProvider.delete(pineconeIds);
}
```

## Database Operations

### PostgreSQL
- Uses Prisma transactions for atomic bulk deletion
- Ensures all-or-nothing deletion (no partial failures)
- Maintains data integrity

### Pinecone Vector Store
- Batch deletion of embeddings
- Keeps vector store in sync with PostgreSQL
- Efficient API usage with bulk operations

## UI Components

### Table Structure
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Bulk Action Banner - Shows when items selected]        │
├───┬───────┬───────┬────────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────┤
│ ☑ │ Image │ Title │ Vendor │ Type │ Firmness│ Actions  │
├───┼───────┼───────┼────────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ ☑ │  🖼️   │ ...   │  ...   │ ...  │   ...   │ Edit│Del│
│ □ │  🖼️   │ ...   │  ...   │ ...  │   ...   │ Edit│Del│
│ ☑ │  🖼️   │ ...   │  ...   │ ...  │   ...   │ Edit│Del│
└───┴───────┴───────┴────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────────┘
```

### Banner Layout
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ℹ️  3 products selected    [Delete Selected] ✕    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Error Handling

- Backend validates all product IDs before deletion
- Transaction rollback on any deletion failure
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Graceful handling of partial Pinecone failures

## Accessibility

- All checkboxes have proper `ariaLabel` attributes
- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Follows Shopify Polaris accessibility guidelines

## Performance Considerations

- Batch operations minimize API calls
- Transaction-based deletion ensures data consistency
- Selections stored in component state (no unnecessary re-renders)
- Efficient filtering of selected products

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential additions if needed:
- Select All across all pages (not just current page)
- Bulk edit functionality using similar pattern
- Export selected products
- Duplicate selected products
- Bulk tag management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Select All**: Test selecting all products on a page
2. **Individual Selection**: Test selecting specific products
3. **Pagination**: Verify selections clear when changing pages
4. **Filters**: Verify selections clear when applying filters
5. **Bulk Delete**: Test deleting 1, 5, and 20+ products
6. **Confirmation Modal**: Verify product list displays correctly
7. **Error Handling**: Test with network errors or permission issues
8. **Toast Notifications**: Verify success/error messages appear
