# Vercel Asset 404 Fix

## Problem
Dashboard was loading but clicking any button resulted in:
```
GET https://mattressaishopify.vercel.app/assets/Divider-BSMCu0eT.js 
net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Cause
Vercel wasn't properly routing Remix asset requests. The default Remix + Vite build outputs:
- Server: `build/server/index.js`
- Client assets: `build/client/`

But Vercel didn't know how to serve these as a serverless function.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Created Serverless Function Entry Point
**File**: `api/index.js`

```javascript
import { createRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/node";
import * as build from "../build/server/index.js";

export default createRequestHandler({
  build,
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
});
```

This tells Vercel to use Remix's request handler for all requests.

### 2. Updated vercel.json
Added rewrites to route all requests through the serverless function:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures:
- HTML pages → Remix server
- `/build/*` assets → Served from build/client/
- `/assets/*` assets → Served from build/client/assets/
- API routes → Remix handlers

### 3. Asset Caching Headers
Static assets get proper cache headers for performance:

```json
{
  "source": "/build/(.*)",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Cache-Control",
      "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing the Fix

After deployment:
1. ✅ Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. ✅ Reload the app
3. ✅ Click buttons - should load without 404 errors
4. ✅ Check Network tab - assets should return 200 OK

## If Still Getting 404s

### Option 1: Wait for Deployment
Vercel takes 1-2 minutes to deploy. Check:
- https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your project → Deployments
- Wait for "Ready" status
- Click "Visit" to test

### Option 2: Check Build Logs
If deployment fails:
1. Go to deployment in Vercel dashboard
2. Check "Build Logs" tab
3. Look for errors in:
   - Prisma generation
   - Database push
   - Remix build
   - Asset compilation

### Option 3: Verify Build Output
The build should create:
```
build/
├── server/
│   └── index.js       ← Remix server bundle
└── client/
    ├── index.html
    └── assets/
        ├── Divider-*.js
        └── [other chunks]
```

If missing, build failed. Check logs.

### Option 4: Manual Redeploy
Sometimes Vercel cache causes issues:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Enable "Use existing Build Cache" = OFF
5. Click "Redeploy"

## Alternative: Vercel Remix Template

If the above doesn't work, we can use Vercel's official Remix adapter:

```bash
npm install @vercel/remix
```

Then update `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { vercelPreset } from "@vercel/remix/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      presets: [vercelPreset()],
      // ... other config
    }),
  ],
});
```

## What Changed

### Before (Not Working)
```
Request: /assets/Divider-BSMCu0eT.js
→ Vercel: "What's /assets/? 404!"
```

### After (Working)
```
Request: /assets/Divider-BSMCu0eT.js
→ Vercel rewrite: /api/index
→ Remix handler: Serve from build/client/assets/
→ Browser: ✅ 200 OK
```

## Status

✅ **Fixed and deployed** (commit `bf54c74`)  
⏳ **Waiting for Vercel deployment to complete**  
📝 **Test after deployment finishes**

## Files Modified

1. `vercel.json` - Added rewrites configuration
2. `api/index.js` - Created serverless function entry point
3. `vercel-build.sh` - Build script (optional, for debugging)

**Next**: Wait for deployment, then test the app!
