# Indexing System Refactoring - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The product indexing system has been successfully refactored to address critical bugs, add background job processing, and improve error handling and observability. This document summarizes what was implemented and what steps are needed to deploy these changes.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETE)

### 1.1 Prisma Singleton Pattern ‚úÖ

**Problem Fixed:** Multiple `PrismaClient()` instances causing connection pool exhaustion

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/db.server.ts` with singleton pattern
- Updated 13+ files to use the singleton:
  - `app/workers/indexer.ts`
  - `app/routes/app.admin.index.start/route.tsx`
  - `app/routes/app.admin.catalog-indexing/route.jsx`
  - `app/lib/billing/billing.service.ts`
  - `app/lib/quota/quota.service.ts`
  - `app/lib/enrichment/product-enrichment.service.ts`
  - All route files and services

**Impact:** Prevents database connection exhaustion and memory leaks

---

### 1.2 JSONL Parsing Fix ‚úÖ

**Problem Fixed:** Shopify Bulk Operations return JSONL (newline-delimited JSON), not regular JSON

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `pollBulkOperation()` in `app/workers/indexer.ts` (lines 439-457)
- Now correctly parses JSONL format:
  - Splits by newline
  - Filters out metadata rows (`__parentId`)
  - Handles parse errors gracefully

**Impact:** Indexing will now work correctly with Shopify's bulk operation API

---

### 1.3 Configuration Management ‚úÖ

**Problem Fixed:** Magic numbers scattered throughout code

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/lib/config/indexing.config.ts`
- Centralized all configuration:
  - `PRODUCT_BATCH_SIZE`: 50
  - `AI_CLASSIFICATION_BATCH_SIZE`: 15
  - `MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS`: 60
  - `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`: 10000
  - `BATCH_DELAY_MS`: 100
  - `AI_BATCH_DELAY_MS`: 250
  - `STALE_JOB_THRESHOLD_MS`: 30 minutes
  - `MAX_UNCERTAIN_PRODUCTS_FOR_AI`: 200
- Updated `app/workers/indexer.ts` to use config values
- Updated `app/routes/app.admin.index.start/route.tsx` for stale job threshold

**Impact:** Easier to tune performance and maintain consistency

---

### 1.4 Standardized Error Handling ‚úÖ

**Problem Fixed:** Inconsistent error handling strategies

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/lib/errors/indexing-errors.ts` with:
  - `ErrorSeverity` enum (CRITICAL, BATCH, PRODUCT)
  - Custom error classes:
    - `IndexingError` (base class)
    - `ShopifyAPIError`
    - `BulkOperationError`
    - `ProductEnrichmentError`
    - `VectorStoreError`
    - `AIClassificationError`
  - `ErrorCounter` class for tracking failures
  - `handleIndexingError()` utility
- Updated `app/workers/indexer.ts` to use new error system
- Added error tracking throughout indexing workflow

**Impact:** Better error visibility and recovery strategies

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Background Job Processing (COMPLETE)

### 2.1 Inngest Integration ‚úÖ

**Problem Fixed:** Jobs run in HTTP request context, lost on server restart

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/lib/inngest/client.ts` - Inngest client setup
- Created `app/lib/inngest/functions/indexing.ts` - Job definition with:
  - 3 automatic retries
  - 30-minute timeout
  - Proper job status updates
- Created `app/routes/api.inngest/route.ts` - Webhook endpoint
- Updated `app/routes/app.admin.index.start/route.tsx` to trigger Inngest jobs

**Impact:** Jobs are now resilient, retryable, and survive server restarts

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Enhanced Error Handling & Observability (COMPLETE)

### 4.1 Structured Logging ‚úÖ

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/lib/logger.ts` with:
  - JSON-formatted logs (Vercel Log Drain compatible)
  - Log levels: debug, info, warn, error
  - Child loggers with default metadata
  - `PerformanceLogger` class for tracking execution time
- Integrated into `app/workers/indexer.ts`:
  - Logs job start/completion with metadata
  - Tracks job duration
  - Structured error logging

**Impact:** Better production debugging and monitoring

---

### 4.2 Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff ‚úÖ

**Changes Made:**
- Created `app/lib/utils/retry.ts` with:
  - `retryWithBackoff()` - Exponential backoff
  - `retryWithLinearBackoff()` - Linear backoff
  - `retryWithFixedDelay()` - Fixed delay
  - `retryIfRetryable()` - Smart retry for network errors
  - `isRetryableError()` - Detects retryable errors
  - `retryBatch()` - Batch retry operations
- Integrated into `app/workers/indexer.ts`:
  - Product enrichment (2 retries, 500ms initial)
  - Embedding generation (3 retries, 1s initial)
  - Vector upsert (3 retries, 2s initial)

**Impact:** Better resilience to transient failures (network, rate limits)

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install inngest
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```env
# Inngest Configuration
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=your_event_key_here
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=your_signing_key_here
```

**How to get Inngest keys:**
1. Sign up at https://www.inngest.com/
2. Create a new project
3. Go to "Keys" section
4. Copy the Event Key and Signing Key

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: Indexing system with Inngest, improved error handling, and observability"

# Push to your repository
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy (or use Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Register Inngest Functions

After deployment:
1. Go to Inngest Dashboard
2. Add your deployment URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/inngest`
3. Inngest will automatically discover and register your functions

### Step 5: Test the Indexing System

1. Navigate to your admin dashboard
2. Click "Re-Index Catalog"
3. Monitor in Inngest Dashboard:
   - Job status
   - Retries
   - Execution time
   - Errors
4. Check Vercel logs for structured JSON logs

## üöÄ What Changed for End Users

**User Experience:**
- ‚úÖ Indexing is now more reliable (automatic retries)
- ‚úÖ Jobs survive server restarts
- ‚úÖ Better error messages in case of failures
- ‚úÖ Improved performance (optimized retries, better error handling)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- UI remains the same
- API endpoints remain the same
- Database schema unchanged

---

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### Structured Logs

All logs are now JSON format in Vercel:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Starting indexing job",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "jobId": "job-123",
  "tenant": "store.myshopify.com",
  "useAIEnrichment": true
}
```

### Inngest Dashboard

Monitor jobs at https://app.inngest.com/:
- Real-time job status
- Retry history
- Error details
- Execution timeline
- Performance metrics

### Error Tracking

Errors are now categorized:
- **CRITICAL**: Job fails immediately
- **BATCH**: Skip batch, continue with next
- **PRODUCT**: Skip product, continue with others

Check error summary in logs:
```json
{
  "errors": {
    "critical": 0,
    "batch": 2,
    "product": 5,
    "total": 7
  }
}
```

---

## üîß Configuration Tuning

Edit `app/lib/config/indexing.config.ts` to adjust:

```typescript
export const INDEXING_CONFIG = {
  PRODUCT_BATCH_SIZE: 50,          // Increase for faster processing
  AI_CLASSIFICATION_BATCH_SIZE: 15, // Decrease to reduce API costs
  MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS: 60,            // Increase for large catalogs
  POLL_INTERVAL_MS: 10000,          // Decrease for faster feedback
  // ... more options
};
```

---

## üéØ Phase 3: Architecture Improvements (OPTIONAL - NOT IMPLEMENTED)

These improvements are **optional** and can be done incrementally:

### Future Enhancements (If Needed):

1. **Extract Services** (if codebase becomes hard to maintain):
   - `ShopifyBulkFetcherService`
   - `ProductFilterService`
   - `VectorIndexingService`
   - `JobProgressTracker`

2. **Refactor ProductIndexer** (if adding more complex logic):
   - Transform into slim orchestrator
   - Each service handles its domain

3. **Stream Processing** (if catalogs exceed 1000+ products):
   - Process products as they arrive
   - Reduce memory footprint

**Current Status:** Not needed for 50-200 product catalogs. Current implementation is sufficient.

- **Error Recovery**: Smart error categorization (critical vs recoverable)

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise:

1. **Disable Inngest temporarily:**
   - Remove Inngest environment variables
   - Code will fall back to direct execution (comment out Inngest send)

2. **Revert to previous version:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Database**: No migrations needed, safe to rollback
